	19.醒时只愿朝花笑，醉时只愿对花眠。生活里总是有太多压力，要么它把你压倒，要么你把它举起。很多事情，看穿但不说穿，只要自己心里有数就好了，没必要说出来。
　　不知不觉，登上一道山岭。眼前是一道深谷，虽说人可以自由上下，但杂草横生，几乎看不到坡面。深谷的前端，是一片很大的核桃树林，骡子圈村以前就在这里，遗留的房子早成废墟，但因为寂静，时常让人觉出阴森。听爷爷说过，这里死过不少人，有被日本鬼子杀死的，也有自己想不开上吊或者用菜刀自杀的。要是一个人，我是不敢到下面去的，和弟弟一起。胆子自然大些。但我们也觉得，上面有我们一辈子都割不完的荆柴，干么要跑到谷底割呢？

19. I woke up only to laugh, is willing to sleep only when drunk.
Life always have too much pressure, either it overwhelm you, either you lift it.
A lot of things, see through but not disclose, as long as their heart several good, don't need to say it.
Unconsciously, on a mountain.
At present is a deep canyons, although people can freely up and down, but weeds, almost can't see the slope.
Deep canyons of the front end, is a very large walnut grove, mule circle village ago right here, already become ruins left house, but because of the silent, always let a person feel out of the dark.
To listen to my grandfather said that death too many people here, have killed by Japanese devils, have their own hard commit suicide by hanging or commit suicide with a kitchen knife.
If a person, I am afraid to go below, together with brother.
Natural daring.
But we also think with JingChai we cut up the rest of my life, doing the bottom to cut?
